  - ChapterPage: 'Bahamut. The platinum Dragon.

      When the planes of mortals
      and gods were connected he was the first deity that gave humans free wil and
      shelter from the destruction of the God Wars.

      When the demons threatened
      to destroy the mortal realm in an effort to weaken Bahamut''s influence, the
      Platinum dragon bestowed his power to a Champion whose name is long forgotten
      and known only as Bahamut''s chosen. '

  - ChapterPage: '30 Years ago, during the peak of the Great Lich war appeared the
      newest Bahamut''s Chosen. A man named Bezelgos.

      With his charisma and
      the blessing of Bahamut he persuaded the five kings of Draco Singaia to join
      their armies and decimated the liches and their undead armies in a single battle.

      Sadly,
      not long after the fight Bezelgos perished from his wounds, leaving the position
      of Bahamut''s chosen empty once again.'
